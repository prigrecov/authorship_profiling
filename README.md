# authorship_profiling
Code for a classification problem task, where the aim is to develop a classifier that can assign a set of twitter texts to their corresponding labels in order to return the corresponding author's gender as accurate as possible.

The pdf file describes in details the context and tasks to be performed. This project was developed as an assessment work for the unit FIT5149-Applied Data Analysis of the Master of Data Science at Monash University, Australia.

The scritp-codes are in the three .ipynb files (jupyter notebooks) - parts I, II and III. The original dataset of twitter texts are inside the \data directory. The other files were generated by the scritp-codes.
